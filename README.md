# Business Analytics Practicum (MGT 6214): Integrating Real-World Data for Better Decision Making in Business

The Business Analytics Practicum at Georgia Tech pairs teams of master's and PhD students from various schools with participating companies and organizations for a semester-long, consulting-style project. After an initial meeting with the company representative, student teams tackle a specific business analytics challenge or opportunity. Throughout the semester, each team defines the clientâ€™s business issue as an analytics problem, analyzes the provided data, and generates actionable business insights. They also develop models or approaches and deliver recommendations based on their findings and analysis.
