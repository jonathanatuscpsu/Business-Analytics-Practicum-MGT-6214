The Business Analytics Practicum at Georgia Tech pairs teams of master's and PhD students from various schools with participating companies and organizations for a semester-long, consulting-style project. After an initial meeting with the company representative, student teams tackle a specific business analytics challenge or opportunity. Throughout the semester, each team defines the clientâ€™s business issue as an analytics problem, analyzes the provided data, and generates actionable business insights. They also develop models or approaches and deliver recommendations based on their findings and analysis.
